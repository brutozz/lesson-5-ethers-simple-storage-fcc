# Lesson # 5 > Ethers Simple Storage FCC

This code was written as part of my introduction to full-blockchain-solidity-course-js from @PatrickAlphaC

Here we also interacted with the old familiar SimpleStorage.sol, which is designed to store the user's favorite number. It has a function to add a favorite number, read it, and there is also a function to add a person and their favorite number to mapping.

We learned how to create and run projects with nodejs, and interacted via wsl (ubuntu). We learned about dependencies in package.json, and tried adding a script there, thus minimizing the typing of long commands. We familiarized ourselves with importing third-party packages into our js file. We tried to use async / await keywords in practice.
We also familiarized ourselves with the ethers package, which is used to interact with the blockchain in js. We learned how .env and .gitignore files work, as well as private key encryption and decryption. Among other things, we gained experience in deploying and interacting with a smart contract not only on the local blockchain (using ganache) but also on the sepolia test network. We also manually verified the code of our smart contract.
